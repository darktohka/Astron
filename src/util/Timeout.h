// This class abstracts the uvw::timer_handle timer in order to provide a generic
// facility for timeouts. Once constructed, this class will wait a certain
// amount of time and then call the function. The timeout must be canceled
// with cancel() before you invalidate your callback.
//
// You must start the timeout with start().
//
// NOTE: The thread that calls the function is the main thread.
// Make sure that your callback doesn't have unintended consequences on performance.
// NOTE 2: The Timeout deletes itself under 2 different conditions:
// a) The timeout has been reached
// b) cancel() has been invoked on the Timeout object.
// In both cases, make SURE that your reference to the Timeout object is set to nullptr and that no further invocations occur.
